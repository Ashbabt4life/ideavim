 * A stub that can be placed in the [SharedTestCaseList] to resolve compilation issues

 * This class can be used to temporarily stub unimplemented functionality in cases where,
 * due to varying development speeds, one of the IDEs hasn't fully implemented vim-engine features.
 * It serves as a placeholder, allowing compilation to succeed while marking areas that need future attention.
